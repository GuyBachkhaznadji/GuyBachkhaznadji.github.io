          <p class ="smalltitle">Genesis</P>
          <p>GOBO started off with a simple, honest dream. That dream was, to eat home made cake every day. Getting people to make cake for you every week for a third of the year is hard. Many try and many fail in this timeless struggle to consume an ever-increasing amount of cake.
          </p>
          <p>Guy, being an innovator looked around himself and analysed his environment. He decided he would not ask for cake like anyone else or make it himself. No, he recognised that he was in a highly competitive environment. The kind of environment where you can make people do just about anything if you tell them they’ll be able to show off that they’re better at something than someone else and there might be a prize. Hence the Great Office Bake came to be.
          </p>
          <p>Today  we can honestly say our lives are more filled with cake and magic thanks to Guy Bake-Off.

          <p class ="smalltitle">The Transformation of Guy Bake-Off</p>
          <p>A story inspired by The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka</p>
          <p>One sunny January morning, Guy arrived at work, sat down at his desk and started getting ready for the day ahead. Unusually, he was the first one to arrive at work that day. Guy had been working at Parity for a few years now and was still was baffled at how late he was every morning. But today he was early, as this wasn’t any ordinary day. Today was the Great Office Bake Off technical challenge. The night before he almost couldn’t sleep with excitement at all the cake he was going to get to eat. </p>

          <p>Guy decided to go to the bathroom to admire himself in the mirror. When he got there he noticed the top of his head had transformed into a French Fancy. Today he had to be careful not to eat himself. Guy felt he looked a bit like a mushroom but still quite dashing. Just above his ears his head was pink, smelled like strawberries and had a classy paper cup base that fed into the side of his head. Luckily, Guy had put his NASA jumper on the night before in anticipation of today. </p>

          <p>Guy went about his official GOBO business, this varied day to day. Sometimes he’d be sitting in a meeting taking legal advice from Lead GOBO Solicitor Billy Henchy or asking the GOBO Development Team when they expected to finish the video game they promised him months ago. Today Guy needed to set up the presenting table and produce a scoring matrix. Guy had decided the best way to keep things anonymous was to use playing cards. A few people had pointed out to Guy that using just letters or numbers would work equally well but Guy felt this wouldn’t overcomplicate the process enough. For him, GOBO was all about the fun of overcomplicating things. He laid out the playing cards and post it notes all around the table, trying to select what he considered to be exciting play cards - these were face cards or aces. Guy was confident that people would prefer the thrill of a face card to a number. There was a smugness about Guy that nobody had seen before. </p>

          <p>Once Guy had completed the difficult job of laying out the playing cards and post it notes around the table for the 9 competitors, he returned to his desk to pretend to recruit while he worked on today’s GOBO business. This involved tasks such as updating his Mary Berry scrapbook, plotting revenge on Fiona for knocking him out of his own competition and thinking about when NASA were going to allow him to visit the Moon Base they’d built for him. He pondered whether to bring this up with them when they arrived, he decided today was not the right day. Guy then realised that he had, without noticing, been picking at and eating part of his head. He tasted good. He felt around the hole he had created just inside the paper cup. It was small, probably the size of a £2 coin. He was satisfied after his inspection that all was well. </p>

          <p>After another 15 minutes of trying to avoid eating himself people started to shuffle into the office. They were immediately impressed and slightly concerned by Guy’s French Fancy head. Everyone presumed that Guy had baked a giant cake hat, it’s the kind of thing he would do. This suited him well as he wanted to get on with proceedings. He finished producing his scoring matrix, which would be used to score each baker on taste, presentation, flavour and consistency. Guy felt he would score himself 10 out of 10 on all counts. </p>

        <section class="why">
          <h3>Why does it need a game?</h3>

          <p>Are you disappointed with not progressing to the next stage of GOBO and wish you had a second chance? Well dream no more!</p>
          <p>GOBO Gaming Studios will be producing a 2D RPG where you can battle your way through various levels to win GOBO! This will be revolutionary, as Mary Berry who is an avid gamer, confessed to our chairman Guy Bake-Off that she’s always disappointed that the real Bake Off doesn’t have an RPG element.
